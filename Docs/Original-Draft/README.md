A game about a fictional way to take digital objects into the real world, its impact and its consequences.

## Science fiction

It is impossible to take digital objects and make them into physical objects (unless you are printing paper, or certain 3D printer objects) there is no possibility of this being possible. If there was, more effort would go into it than there would be in things like cancer research. If it was possible, every government in the world would be trying to utilize this power, as the first government to do so could spawn enough equipment to take over the entire world in less than 1 second (if a country spawned 44 billion tanks, no-one would dare fight them, they would just surrender, as they would be faced against more tanks than the world has people)
